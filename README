== Django Holding Page ==

An out-the-box viral holding page for your websites with export functionality.

Was developed for another of my projects, http://www.rpg-engine.com

Feel free to download, modify or adapt this for your own needs. Contact me at http://www.danieldavies.co.uk if you'd like me to quote you for a hosted or custom viral holding page.

= Features=

- Users can provide their email address and name which is saved in to the database for future exports to systems such as Campaign Monitor.
- Each user is sent a viral code, which allows them to share your holding page with other people and build up points.
- Complete use of templates - configure the entire app to your own needs without touching the code

= Usage =

git clone git://github.com/danux/Django-Holding-Page.git
cd Django-Holding-Page
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd holdingpage
./manage.py test
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py runserver
Restyle subscriber/templates/subscriber/*.html
Reword subscriber/templates/email/welcome.txt to suit your project

= Development Roadmap/Ideas =

- Auto-export to Campaign Monitor, Sales Force, etc
- "Reserve my username" feature
- Make it easy to integrate this as a beta holding pen for Django projects (i.e. issue beta invites to your subscribers)
- Will i8n it at some point (though it really wouldn't be hard to do yourself)
- Any thing else you fancy adding/suggesting - Fork away!
